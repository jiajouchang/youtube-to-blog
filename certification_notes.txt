**Mechanism & Permissions:**

- **activeTab / scripting**: Required to access the DOM of the active YouTube tab to extract the `ytInitialPlayerResponse` for caption data.
- **sidePanel**: Provides the primary user interface.

**Privacy Declaration:**
This extension operates entirely client-side. It makes direct API calls to Google's Gemini API using the user's key. No user data, browsing history, or transcripts are collected or stored by the developer.
